Prediction and 10-year Risk Assessment of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events using Machine Learning Techniques

## Introduction
Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) are
defined as the occurrence of any episode including death, stroke,
thromboembolic event, acute myocardial infarction and stent
thrombosis or target lesion revascularisation. The prediction
of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) could play an essential
role in supporting clinical decisions that allow timely intervention
for preventable and treatable complications. It could also allow
management of low-risk patients without unnecessary admissions, investigations and monitoring. The risk models have played
an important role in primary prevention and are often used
in everyday clinical practice.  This work proposes machine
learning techniques for estimating a 10-year prediction of major
adverse cardiovascular event. Supervised learning algorithms
and classifiers such as Decisions Tree, Logistic Regression, KNearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used
to differentiate a healthy patient from an unhealthy one. The
study also shows the comparison of these methods in classification
of patients.
